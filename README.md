This data set contains the per capita (persons aged 14+) consumption of ethanol (in gallons) for each state and Washington D.C. for the years 1977-2016. This includes total ethanol consumed as well as consumption by three categories: beer, wine, and spirits. The PDF includes a method to convert the data into different units such as number of beers, glasses of wine, and shots of spirit.

This data comes from a report by Sarah P. Haughwout and Dr. Megan E. Slater at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. That report is one of the files available to download and is included as it explains the methodology the two authors used for the data. 

I am not affiliated with the report at all. The only work that I did was to take the PDF and scrape the data from Table 4 (Per capita ethanol consumption for States, census regions, and the United States, 1977-2016) into R and save it in an Excel file for easy use. For the code uses to clean and read the data, and the tests to ensure my code is accurate, please see my GitHub file here: https://github.com/jacobkap/alcohol

I downloaded the PDF from here: https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/surveillance110/CONS16.htm
